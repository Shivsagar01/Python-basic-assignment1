A lambda function doesn’t contain a return statement because it will have only a single expression which is always returned by default. You don’t even have to assign a lambda either as it can be immediately invoked (see the next section). As you will see in the following example, lambdas become particularly powerful when we use them with Python’s built-in functions.<br>\n",

    "As you can see in the diagram, the two definitions are handled in the same way by the python interpreter when converted to bytecode. Now, you cannot name a function lambda because it is reserved by Python, but any other function name will yield the same bytecode[KR6]."

    "The scope defines the accessibility of the python object. To access the particular variable in the code, the scope must be defined as it cannot be accessed from anywhere in the program. The particular coding region where variables are visible is known as scope. Variables are not visible to the entire code; their visibility can be restricted. Scope verifies which variable can be ‘Seen’. The scope defines the set of rules which tell us how and where a variable can be searched. The variable is searched either to retrieve a value or for assigning value. The namespace is the unique identification of the variable or the method. Namespace tells the python interpreter about the name of the object and the location from where it is trying to access it.\n",

    "The Namespaces are searched for scope resolution according to the LEGB rule. The LEGB stands for: L: Local, E: Enclosed, G: Global, B: Built-in. The sequence of LEGB is important. The variable is first searched in Local, followed by Enclosed, then global and finally built-in.\n",

    "\n",
    "**What is Pass by Reference?**<br>\n",
    "•\t**Pass means** to provide an argument to a function.<br>\n",
    "•\t**By reference means** that the argument you’re passing to the function is a reference to a variable that already exists in memory rather than an independent copy of that variable.<br>\n",

    "**Result:** All operations performed on this reference will directly affect the variable to which it refers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pass by Value:**<br>\n",
    "On the other hand, when you pass arguments by value, those arguments become independent copies of the original values.\n",
    "Let me rephrase it in a detailed manner. In pass-by-value, the function is provided with a copy of the argument object passed to it by the caller. That means the original object stays intact and all changes made are to a copy of the same and stored at different memory locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What’s Pass Object by Reference?**\n",
    "The functions in Python receive the reference of the same object in the memory as referred by the caller. However, the function does not receive the variable (the bucket) that the caller is storing the same object in; like in pass-by-value, the function provides its own bucket and creates an entirely new variable for itself.\n",

    "**Too complicated to understand? No worries! Let me explain in layman terms!**<br>\n",
    "1.In Python, variables are not passed by reference or by value.<br>\n",
